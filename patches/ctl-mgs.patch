IB don't provide generic way to know about transfer.
So we need to define a some control protocol to notify peer about
transfer.
One of two ways may choosed for it.
1) use a generic send / recv functions
2) use MAD (CM) message to exchange a transfer parameters.

use a (1) for initial implementation.

part I - init transfer related structures

IB uses QP - queue pair to transfer data between nodes.
CP is completion pair - transmission events callback.
Control messages uses an global memory region with predefined
key to mark an transfer.
