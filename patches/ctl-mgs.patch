IB don't provide generic way to know about transfer.
So we need to define a some control protocol to notify peer about
transfer.
One of two ways may choosed for it.
1) use a generic send / recv functions 
2) use MAD (CM) message to exchange a transfer parameters.

use a (1) for initial implementation.
